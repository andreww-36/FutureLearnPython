# Implement these features:
# A class, Enemy, that starts with three lives.
# A method to attack the enemy and reduce its life count by one.
# A method to check the enemyâ€™s life count and either report when the enemy loses a life, or report that the enemy is dead.
# Generate three instances of the enemy in the program and attack the enemies to reduce their life count.
